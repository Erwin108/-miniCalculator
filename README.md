# -miniCalculator
This software is meant to practice unit test building. The core code is a simple calculator to get the feel of creating the unit test and understand the extra work that it requires.
Checking multiplication we start with 5 and if the result is anything but 5 it fails. 
Checking division we start with 2 and if the result is anything but 2 it fails.
